\section{Signals and Signal Space}

\subsection{Signal Strength}

\subsubsection{Power}

\textbf{Signal Energy} $E_g$ is the energy that the voltage of $g(t)$ dissipates on a resistor. From circuits, we know that $E = V^2/R$, so for a time based signal with no theoretical $R$:

$$E_g = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}|g(t)|^2 dt$$

When dealing with complex signals:

$$E_g = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}g(t)g^*(t) dt$$

Where the orthogonal signal $g^*(t)$ indicates that all $j$ units in $g(t)$ are negative.

\subsubsection{Power}

\textbf{Signal Power} is the measure of a signal where signal energy isn't finite. For a signal that doesn't go to zero as $t \rightarrow \infty$, a time average of the energy $P_g$ can be taken over a period $T$:

$$P_g = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_{T/2}^{-T/2} |g(t)|^2 dt$$

Similar to energy signals, when $g(t)$ is a complex signal:

$$P_g = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_{T/2}^{-T/2} g(t)g^*(t) dt$$


\hfill \break 
The square of $P_g$ is the \textbf{Root Mean Square} of value $g(t)$.

\subsubsection{Energy and Power Signals}

A signal with finite energy is an \textbf{Energy Signal}, and an signal with finite power is a \textbf{Power Signal}. In other terms, if $E_g < \infty$, or $0 < P_g < \infty$.

\subsection{Important Signals}
\subsubsection{Unit Impulse Signal}

$$\delta(t) = 0, t \neq 0$$
$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\delta(t)dt = 1$$
\hfill \break 
A rectangular pulse of width $\epsilon$ and height $1/\epsilon$, the \textbf{Unit Impulse} is 0 everywhere but at $t = 0$.

$$\phi(t)\delta(t) = \phi(0)\delta(t)$$
$$\phi(t)\delta(t - T) = \phi(T)\delta(t - T)$$

\hfill \break
These equations follow from the understanding that $\delta(t)$ is the only point where the impulse has a value, and likewise when shifted $T$ units. The resulting equation will only be equal to the function $\phi$ at this specific point, multiplied by $\delta$ at this point.

\textbf{Sampling Property}

From the above, it can be seen that:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\phi(t)\delta(t - T) = \phi(T)\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t - T) dt = \phi(T)$$

\hfill \break
The $\phi(T)$ value can be shifted out of the $dt$ integration as a constant, leaving us with the result. This is known as the \textbf{Sampling} or \textbf{Sifting Property}. 

\subsubsection{Unit Step Function}

$$u(t) = \begin{cases}
    0, \quad t < 0 \\
    1, \quad t \geq 0 
\end{cases}1, t \geq 0$$

\hfill \break
$$\int_{-\infty}^{t}\delta(\tau)d\tau =  \begin{cases}
    0,\quad  t < 0 \\
    1, \quad t \geq 0
\end{cases} = u(t)$$

This comes from the knowledge that the area under the impulse function is 1, so any scope of area that encompasses its $t$ will also be equal to 1. 

$$ \frac{du}{dt} = \delta(t)$$

\subsubsection{Exponential Function $e^{{\alpha}t}$}
When $\alpha$ is a pure imaginary signal ($\alpha = j\omega_0 t)$ then exponential signal $e^{{\alpha}t}$ is a unit signal whose period $T_0 = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0}$ \\

$\omega_0$ is the frequency in radians, where $\omega_0t$ is a measurement over the span of time $t$ (frequency $\cdot$ time). As the unit exponential, the magnitude of $e^{{j\omega}t}$ is $\abs{\text{cos}\omega_0t + j\text{sin}\omega_0t}$ = 1

\subsubsection{Rectangle Signal}
A \textbf{Rectangle Signal} $rect(\frac{t}{T})$ is a unit signal of width $T$ which is centered at $t$. $rect(\frac{t}{T})$ can be defined as:

$$rect(\frac{t}{T}) = \begin{cases}
    1,\quad  -\frac{T}{2} \leq t \leq \frac{T}{2}\\
    0, \quad \text{else}
\end{cases}$$

\subsubsection{Triangle Signal}
A \textbf{Triangle Signal} $\Delta(\frac{t}{\tau}$) is defined as:

$$\Delta(\frac{t}{\tau}) = \begin{cases}
    t,   \quad   -\frac{\tau}{2} \leq t \leq 0 \\
    -t,   \quad  0 \leq t \leq \frac{\tau}{2} \\
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Signal Operations}
\subsubsection{Time Shifting}

When shifting a signal $g(t) \rightarrow g(t - T)$, it should be considered that at every point in $t$, the value of $g(t)$ will be the same as as what it would be at time $t - T$. In other words, a signal will be shifted to the right. For $t + T$, a signal will appear shifted to the left.
\subsubsection{Time Scaling}

When scaling a signal $g(t) \Rightarrow g(\alpha t)$ it should be considered that the value of the new signal will be whatever the signal was originally at time $\alpha t$. Therefore, when $\alpha > 1$, a signal will appear compressed by a value $\alpha$ about its point of origin. When $\alpha < 1$, it will appear lengthened. This will be centered at the point $t$, or a shifted time value.
\subsubsection{Time Reversal}
This will be the same as scaling, only the signal is inverted at its time of origin.
\subsubsection{Complex Operation}
When performing an operation which involves shifting and scaling, the function should be converted to the form $g(t)$ by removing the scaling from the signal equation. So for $g(\alpha t + T)$, the function will be $g(\alpha(t + \frac{T}{\alpha}))$. This will be the original signal $g(t)$ scaled by $\alpha$ and shifted by $\frac{1}{\alpha}$. Obey the order of operations by scaling before shifting.

\subsection{System Characterization}

$$x(t) \Rightarrow S \Rightarrow y(t) = S[x(t)] $$ 

\textbf{Linear} \quad $S[ax_1(t) + bx_2(t)] = aS[x_1(t)] + bS[x_2(t)] = ay_1(t) = by_2(t)$ \\
\textbf{Time-Invariant}  \quad $S[x_1(t-t_0) = y(t-t_0)])$

\section{Analysis of Signals}

\subsection{Fourier Series}
For exponential signal $e^{jw_0t}$ for frequency $w_0$, some properties are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fundamental period $T_0 = \frac{2\pi}{w_0}$
    \item $\abs{e^{j\omega_0t}}$ = 1
    \item $e^{jw_0t}$ = cos($\omega_0t$) + $j$sin($\omega_0t$)
    \item There are a set of harmonically related $\phi_k(t) = e^{jk\omega_0t}$. This $\phi_k(t)$ is orthogonal, so that
\end{itemize}

$$ \int_{T_0}\phi_n(t)\phi^*_m(t)dt = \int_{T_0}e^{jw_0t}e^{-jmw_0t}dt = \begin{cases}
    T_0,\quad n = m \\
    0, \quad n \neq m
\end{cases}$$

When the $m$ and $n$ values are equal, the value of $e^{jw_0t(n-m)}$ will be 1 - otherwise, it will become a combination of sin and cos signals, which sum to 0. \\ 

Orthgonality can be defined as:

$$\int^{t_2}_{t_1}x_1(t)x^*_2(t)dt = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \int^{t_2}_{t_1}x^*_1(t)x_2(t)dt = 0$$
\hfill \break
When the signals are real, this can be generalized as:

$$\int^{t_2}_{t_1}x_1(t)g(t)dt = 0$$

\subsubsection{Exponential Fourier Series}
Using these exponential signals, a signal $g(t)$ be be represented using a summation:

$$g(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}D_ne^{jn\omega_0t}$$

$D_n$ is the \textbf{Fourier Series coefficients}

$$D_n = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0}g(t)e^{-jn\omega_0t}dt$$

So that:

$$D_n = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}D_ne^{jn\omega_0t}e^{-jn\omega_0t}dt$$
\hfill \break
For orthogonal signals as defined above, this will sum to $D_n$.
\\ \\
\textbf{Note}: If $g(t)$ is real, $D_{-n} = D^*_n$
\subsubsection{Parseval's Theorem}

The power of a periodic signal g(t) is:

$$P_g = \sum^\infty_{n=-\infty}\abs{D_n}^2$$
\subsubsection{Trigonometric Fourier Series}
If the periodic $g(t)$ is \textbf{real}, we can represent it using the trigonometric FS:

$$g(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\text{cos}(n\omega_0t) + \sum_{n=-1}^{\infty} b_n\text{sin}(n\omega_0t)$$
